## Search Functionality Testing

### Core Search Features Tested

1. **Basic Search**:
   - Text matching across resource names
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Partial string matching

2. **Advanced Search Syntax**:
   - `type:vm` - Filter by resource type
   - `location:eastus` - Filter by location
   - `tag:env=prod` - Filter by tags
   - `rg:mygroup` - Filter by resource group

3. **Wildcard Matching**:
   - `vm*` - Prefix matching
   - `*prod*` - Contains matching
   - `test?` - Single character wildcard
   - Complex patterns: `web-*-prod`

4. **Real-time Features**:
   - Search suggestions as you type
   - Instant result filtering
   - Relevance-based ranking
   - Performance optimized for large datasets

### Test Coverage Areas

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and memory benchmarks
- **Edge Cases**: Empty results, special characters, large datasets
- **UI Integration**: Keyboard navigation, visual feedback

### Performance Benchmarks

The CI pipeline includes performance benchmarks for:
- Search query parsing speed
- Result filtering performance
- Memory usage during large searches
- Real-time suggestion generation speed

## Quality Gates

### Required Checks

All these checks must pass before code can be merged:

1. ‚úÖ **Code Formatting**: Must be properly formatted
2. ‚úÖ **Unit Tests**: All tests must pass (including search tests)
3. ‚úÖ **Linting**: No linting errors allowed
4. ‚úÖ **Security**: No security vulnerabilities
5. ‚úÖ **Search Integration**: Search functionality must be properly integrated
6. ‚úÖ **Build Success**: All platform builds must succeed

### Optional Checks

These provide additional insights but don't block merges:

- üìä **Coverage Reports**: Track test coverage trends
- üèÉ **Performance Benchmarks**: Monitor search performance
- üîç **Search Feature Tests**: Comprehensive search functionality validation

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

- `GO_VERSION`: Go version for builds (currently 1.21)
- `APP_NAME`: Application name for artifacts (azure-tui)

### Optional Variables

- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For coverage reporting (set in repository secrets)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Artifacts

### Build Artifacts

Each platform build produces:
- Compiled binary (`azure-tui-{os}-{arch}`)
- SHA256 checksum file
- Retained for 30 days

### Test Artifacts

- Coverage reports (HTML and raw data)
- Search performance benchmarks
- Test logs and results

### Release Artifacts

- All platform binaries
- Combined checksums file
- Documentation files
- Release archive

## Usage Examples

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
just deps

# Run all tests including search
just test

# Run only search tests
just test-pkg search

# Build with search functionality
just build

# Test search functionality specifically
./test_search_functionality.sh
```

### CI Debugging

```bash
# Run the same commands as CI locally
go test -v ./internal/search/...
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/search/...
golangci-lint run
gosec ./...
```

## Search Functionality Verification

### Manual Testing Steps

1. Build and run the application: `just build && ./azure-tui`
2. Press `/` to enter search mode
3. Test basic search: type `vm` and press Enter
4. Test advanced syntax: `type:storage location:eastus`
5. Test wildcards: `web-*-prod`
6. Verify suggestions appear as you type
7. Use ‚Üë/‚Üì to navigate results
8. Press Escape to exit search mode

### Automated Testing

The CI pipeline automatically:
- Compiles search package
- Runs all search unit tests
- Verifies search integration
- Benchmarks search performance
- Checks for memory leaks
- Validates search symbols in binary

## Security Considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Search Tests Failing**:
   ```bash
   # Check search package compilation
   go build ./internal/search/...
   
   # Run verbose tests
   go test -v ./internal/search/...
   ```

2. **Build Failures**:
   ```bash
   # Check dependencies
   go mod tidy
   go mod verify
   
   # Test local build
   just build
   ```

3. **Integration Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Verify search integration
   strings ./azure-tui | grep -i search
   
   # Test with mock data
   go run ./cmd/main.go --test-mode
   ```
