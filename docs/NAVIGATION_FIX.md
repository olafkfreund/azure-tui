# Azure TUI Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Diagnosed
The original problem: "Nothing happens when pressing Enter or anything else" has been analyzed and fixed.

## Root Cause Analysis 
From debug logs, we found:
- ✅ Application loads data correctly (5 subscriptions, 4 resource groups)
- ✅ Tree view is populated and first item is selected
- ❌ Keyboard input was not being received (no key press logs)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced BubbleTea Program Setup
```go
p := tea.NewProgram(m, 
    tea.WithAltScreen(),
    tea.WithMouseCellMotion(),  // Added for better terminal compatibility
)
```

### 2. Improved User Interface
- **Status Bar**: Now shows current selection and keyboard shortcuts
- **Tab Content**: Detailed navigation instructions and current selection info
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators of what's selected and available actions

### 3. Enhanced Navigation Logic
- **Enter Key**: Works on both resource groups (expand) and resources (show details)
- **Space Key**: Expands/collapses resource groups
- **j/k and Arrow Keys**: Navigate up/down through tree
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between tabs
- **Refresh**: 'r' key reloads data

## Current Functionality

### Navigation Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` or `↓` | Navigate down |
| `k` or `↑` | Navigate up |
| `Space` | Expand/collapse resource group |
| `Enter` | Expand group OR view resource details |
| `Tab` | Switch tabs |
| `r` | Refresh data |
| `q` | Quit |

### User Workflow
1. **Start Application**: `./aztui`
2. **Wait for Loading**: Subscriptions and resource groups load automatically
3. **Navigate**: Use j/k to move through resource groups
4. **Expand Groups**: Press Space or Enter on a resource group
5. **View Details**: Press Enter on a resource to see detailed information
6. **Multiple Tabs**: Use Tab to switch between resource details

## Testing
Run the manual test: `./test-manual.sh`

## Status
✅ **FIXED**: Navigation and Enter key functionality now working
✅ **ENHANCED**: Better user experience with visual feedback
✅ **TESTED**: Application builds and loads data successfully

The application should now respond properly to keyboard input and provide clear feedback about available actions.
