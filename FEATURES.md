#### **Traditional Mode (F2 to toggle)**
- **Two-Panel Layout**: Left panel for resource groups, right for resources
- **Resource Tabs**: Traditional tab system for opened resources
- **Legacy Navigation**: Arrow key navigation between panels

#### **Tab Features**
- **Azure Service Icons**: Resource-specific icons for easy identification
- **Multi-Resource Management**: Open multiple resources simultaneously
- **Tab Management**: Full support for opening, closing, and switching tabs
- **Persistent State**: Tabs maintain their content when switching between them

### Visual Enhancements

- **Responsive Layout**: Panels automatically adjust content
- **Unicode Alignment**: Proper text alignment with Unicode support

### AI Integration

The application integrates with AI providers:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Recommended for enhanced Azure-specific analysis
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Alternative for general analysis and code generation
- **Custom Agents**: Specialized agents for different Azure scenarios

Set up AI integration (choose one):

```bash
# Option 1: GitHub Copilot (Recommended)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export USE_GITHUB_COPILOT="true"  # optional, auto-detected

# Option 2: OpenAI API
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### Demo Mode

If Azure CLI is not configured or unavailable, the application runs in demo mode with sample data, allowing you to explore all features without an active Azure subscription.

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

- **TUI Layer**: Bubble Tea framework with lipgloss styling
- **Azure Integration**: Azure SDK and CLI integration
- **AI Services**: OpenAI client support
- **IaC Support**: Terraform and Bicep code analysis/generation
- **Configuration**: YAML-based user preferences

This enhanced version transforms the basic Azure resource browser into a comprehensive, AI-powered cloud management platform.
